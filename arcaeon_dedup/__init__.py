"""arcaeon-dedup — strip repeated text from an agent's context before it costs tokens.

Retrieved chunks, tool outputs, conversation history, and memory stores fill up
with literal repeats — the same doc pulled twice by two retrievers, the same
boilerplate header on every result, a chunk that overlaps its neighbour, the
same error line logged forty times. Every redundant copy is pure token waste you
pay for on every call.

`dedupe()` finds them with **SimHash** as a fast candidate filter and then
**verifies every candidate pair by direct feature overlap** before dropping
anything. **No LLM call, no embeddings, no network: pure stdlib.** That's the
point — it costs essentially nothing to run, so it's cheap enough to put in
front of every context assembly.

    from arcaeon_dedup import dedupe
    kept, report = dedupe([
        "Docs: the API returns 200 on success. See the reference for details.",
        "Docs: the API returns 200 on success.  See the reference for details.",  # same doc, refetched
        "The database connection timed out after 30 seconds.",
    ])
    # kept -> 2 items (the repeat dropped)
    # report -> DedupeReport(kept=2, removed=1, chars_saved=..., est_tokens_saved=...)

WHAT IT REMOVES, AND WHAT IT WILL NOT — the boundary is the product:

  1. It removes NEAR-VERBATIM repeats: identical text, text differing only in
     whitespace, case, punctuation, or wrapper noise, and chunks whose content
     is substantially the same string. That is the common, expensive case.
  2. It does NOT collapse paraphrase, and it must not pretend to. No lexical
     distance separates "reworded, same meaning" from "one word changed,
     opposite meaning" — "Charge the customer $19" and "Refund the customer
     $19" are lexically CLOSER than any two honest paraphrases of the same
     sentence. A deduper that collapses the second collapses the first, and
     then it is deleting facts. For paraphrase, you need semantics: embeddings.
  3. The one case it can still get wrong: a single inserted or substituted
     token inside a LONG document leaves the two strings overwhelmingly
     identical, so at some length a one-word change reads as a repeat. There
     is no threshold that fixes this in general (it is the same theorem as
     #2). If one-token inversions are load-bearing in your corpus — medical,
     legal, financial records — pass `min_overlap=1.0`, which drops only
     items whose normalized feature sets match exactly.

    Two steps, and the second one is the safety:

      1. CANDIDATES — SimHashes within `max_hamming` bits (of 64). Cheap, wide,
         and on its own wildly over-eager: at 12 bits it will hand you pairs
         that share no words at all.
      2. VERIFICATION — the candidate pair is dropped only if `_overlap` (the
         minimum of character-4-gram and word-bigram Jaccard) is at least
         `min_overlap`. Raising `max_hamming` widens the candidate set; it does
         NOT weaken this gate.

    `min_overlap=0.95` (default) means near-verbatim: whitespace, case,
    punctuation, and small wrapper differences collapse; different facts do
    not. `min_overlap=1.0` drops only exact matches after normalization — use
    it when a one-token difference is never noise. Values below ~0.7 start
    deleting content that is merely related, which is silent data loss; the
    knob is there, but that is what it does.

    `k` is the SimHash shingle width for candidate generation only (1 =
    bag-of-words, wide recall). `keep="first"` keeps the earliest of each
    cluster (best for chronological context); `keep="longest"` keeps the most
    complete phrasing — clusters are formed against fixed representatives
    first and the longest member chosen after, so nothing is ever dropped
    against an item it was not verified against.
