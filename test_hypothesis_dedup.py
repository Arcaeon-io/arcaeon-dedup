"""Hypothesis property suite for arcaeon-dedup.

Companion to the hand-rolled test_dedup.py. Same treatment applied to
arcaeon-continuity, arcaeon-ledger, and arcaeon-distill the night of
2026-08-15/16 -- ledger found a real `splitlines()`-vs-`ensure_ascii=False`
false-mismatch bug on the U+0085/U+2028/U+2029 unicode-line-separator class,
continuity found a probe-file handoff mismatch traced to the same class.
Run against this repo's checkout (`pip install -e .`), never site-packages.

Sections:
  1. Structural invariants — kept+removed==len, order preservation, valid
     removed_indices, determinism.
  2. Idempotence — deduping an already-deduped list should not remove more.
  3. Correctness on known near-duplicates and known distinct pairs.
  4. Argument validation.
  5. The unicode-line-separator class (U+0085/U+2028/U+2029) — THE headline
     check. `arcaeon_dedup` has NO file I/O anywhere (grepped: no `open(`,
     `jsonl`, `splitlines`, or `readlines` in the package) -- it operates
     purely on an in-memory `list[str]`. The specific write-JSONL/read-back-
     with-splitlines() bug class is therefore STRUCTURALLY ABSENT: there is
     no round trip to break. Section 5 instead verifies the class is at
     least handled deterministically and without crashing wherever it CAN
     reach the package's actual surface: `_normalize`, `simhash`, `dedupe`.

# is a pure function over an in-memory list[str]. There is no write side and
# no read-back side for the bug to live in. What follows instead: the class
# does reach `_normalize` (via `_WORD.findall`, which does not match these
# chars -- they are stripped exactly like any other non-word separator,
# same as a plain space), so it must not crash and must behave
# deterministically and consistently with the plain-whitespace case.
